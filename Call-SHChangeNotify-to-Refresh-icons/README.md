# Call the SHChangeNotify function
Referring to https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/shell/how-to-assign-a-custom-icon-to-a-file-type this references making a call to the "SHChangeNotify" but it doesn't say how.

So this PowerShell script is based upon the script from https://superuser.com/questions/1322424/use-chrome-to-open-both-htm-and-pdf-files-but-assign-different-icons-in-win10
